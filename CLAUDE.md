# grpc-webnext — working notes

Full gRPC semantics in the browser — unary over **Fetch**, streaming over
**WebSocket** — on the same port as native gRPC. Polyglot: one wire protocol,
native in-process servers per language, plus a schema-agnostic proxy.

## Layout (organized by language ecosystem; contract at the root)

```
proto/          wire envelope (Frame, Metadatum, …) — shared source of truth
spec/           PROTOCOL.md (normative) + COMPATIBILITY.md
conformance/    language-neutral conformance suite (proto, cases, contract)
doc/            design notes (STATUS, BACKLOG, UNIFICATION, H2TS_INTEGRATION)
rust/           Cargo workspace  ← NOTE: the workspace is here, NOT the repo root
  crates/grpc-webnext/   server library + proxy binary (grpc-webnext-proxy)
  crates/testecho/       test-only Echo service
  crates/devserver/      dev harness (testecho behind the proxy)
  examples/greeter-server/
node/           npm workspace
  packages/client/       @grpc-webnext/client (Fetch + WebSocket)  ✅
  packages/server/       @grpc-webnext/server (in-process)  ⬜ skeleton
go/             Go module github.com/grpc-webnext/grpc-webnext/go
  webnext/               in-process server  ⬜ skeleton
```

## Build & test

```bash
# Rust (server + proxy live in one crate). Run from rust/.
cd rust && cargo test --workspace          # 90 tests
cd rust && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets   # keep clean

# TypeScript client. The e2e/json/promise tests spawn the Rust example servers
# (cargo run in ../rust), so a Rust toolchain is needed for the full suite.
cd node/packages/client && npm install && npm test  # 40 tests

# Go skeleton (stdlib-only; builds + vets clean).
cd go && go build ./... && go vet ./...
```

Servers signal readiness by printing `LISTENING http://<addr>` on stdout — the
harness (and conformance runner) parse that line.

## Architecture

One port; `content-type` and the WebSocket subprotocol disambiguate. Transport is a
per-client config `{ codec, unary, streaming }` (Phases 1–3 of the h2ts pivot are done —
see [doc/H2TS_INTEGRATION.md](doc/H2TS_INTEGRATION.md)):

- **Binary (default) → real gRPC over h2ts.** The browser speaks real HTTP/2 (trailers,
  multiplexing) tunneled over a WebSocket by [h2ts](https://github.com/debdattabasu/h2ts);
  the server is unmodified tonic behind an h2ts gateway — `serve_h2` in-process, or a
  byte-transparent `bridge` in the proxy. No translation on this path (`src/h2ts.rs`,
  client `h2ts-transport.ts`).
- **JSON (and binary `streaming: "ws"`) → the custom `Frame` protocol, single-stream.**
  Unary → Fetch, trailer buffered into the body as `[u32 len | message][u32 len | trailer]`
  (browsers can't read HTTP trailers). Streaming → **one WebSocket per stream** carrying
  `Frame`s (Subscribe / Message / HalfClose / Trailer / Reset / Header); the WS URL is the
  method. Plaintext JSON for browser debuggability. No multiplexing — no `stream_id`.

The in-process server (wrap a tonic `Routes`) and the standalone proxy (front any gRPC
upstream) share one code path via a two-variant `Backend` enum
(`InProcess(Routes)` | `Upstream(Channel)`).

## Audit process

Conformance proves wire-level interop, but it can't catch *subtle* divergence — a
receive-path branch one implementation handles and another silently doesn't, an edge the
spec implies but no test exercises, a behavior that has quietly drifted from the spec's
intent. Two practices catch that:

- **Fresh-context audits.** Periodically a fresh agent — no prior conversation, no
  assumptions carried in — is given the broad **system invariants** (the guarantees in
  `spec/PROTOCOL.md`, the polyglot *share-no-code / stay-interoperable* rule, and the
  intended behavior of each layer: Fetch unary, the custom single-stream `Frame`
  WebSocket, and the real-HTTP/2 h2ts path) and asked to evaluate the **current** state of
  the spec, the tests, and the code against them. It reads the source and tests across
  every stack and reports two things: **logic drift** — where implementations diverge from
  each other or from the spec (the in-process/proxy unification audit found *four* such
  divergences) — and **test-coverage gaps** — paths that are plausible but unproven. Each
  audit is a dated document under `doc/` with a work log that turns every finding into a
  fix or a recorded decision; `doc/STATUS.md` is the running example. Real bugs surface
  exactly this way — the conformance suite's first run found trailing metadata dropped on a
  trailers-only (error) response, on *both* the h2ts client and the Fetch server path, in
  precisely the neighborhood the matrix was built to stress.
- **Author coverage review.** The author also audits test coverage by hand on a regular
  basis, hunting the edge cases conformance and automated tooling tend to miss —
  receive-path robustness, lifecycle/teardown (single-stream WS close, cancellation,
  deadline expiry), size-limit enforcement, and metadata fidelity (`-bin`, trailers-only)
  that only surface under an adversarial reading.

Assume any change will be read this way. Leave the spec, the tests, and the code mutually
consistent, and prefer pinning an edge with a test over trusting that it's "obviously
correct" — the audits exist precisely because obvious-looking code is where the drift
hides.

## Conventions & gotchas

- The Cargo workspace is in `rust/`, not the repo root — `cargo` commands run from there;
  TS harnesses spawn it via `cwd: <repo>/rust`.
- `proto/grpc_webnext.proto` at the repo root is the shared contract and the **only** place
  to edit it; each language generates its own bindings (prost, ts-proto, protoc-gen-go).
  Node and Go *check in* their generated code (the proto is a dev-time codegen input), so their
  packages never ship the `.proto`. Rust generates at **build time** (prost `build.rs` → `OUT_DIR`),
  so the published crate must physically carry the proto — it keeps a **vendored mirror** at
  `rust/crates/grpc-webnext/proto/grpc_webnext.proto`. That copy is a generated artifact, not
  hand-maintained: `build.rs` refreshes it from the root proto on every in-workspace build (and
  compiles from root there), falling back to the mirror only when there's no repo root (a
  crates.io build). The `vendored_proto` test backstops them against drift. Bottom line: edit
  `/proto`, run a Rust build, commit the refreshed mirror alongside.
- `spec/PROTOCOL.md` is normative; `conformance/` is the cross-language anti-drift guard
  (run every server impl × every client driver over the real wire).
- gRPC status codes are canonical; WS pre-RPC rejection uses close code `4000 + code`.
- macOS BSD `sed` has no `\b` word boundaries — don't use them in scripts here.

## A note on how this was built

grpc-webnext is developed in collaboration with **Claude (Anthropic's Claude Code)** —
architectural design, constraints, and direction are driven entirely by the author, with
Claude accelerating implementation, testing, and documentation across the Rust,
TypeScript, and Go stacks. Maintaining this CLAUDE.md is a choice to be upfront about that
leverage rather than burying it.

While AI-assisted authorship is often met with justified suspicion regarding code quality,
grpc-webnext doesn't rely on blind generation. The work stands on its language-neutral
[conformance suite](conformance/) — every server implementation × every client driver ×
every transport and codec, run over the real wire — and the rigorous, human-in-the-loop
adversarial audit process above. AI is the leverage; human verification is the guarantee.
