# grpc-webnext wire protocol

Full gRPC semantics in the browser on one port. The client picks its transport with a
per-client config `{ codec, unary, streaming }`; content-type (request path) and
subprotocol (WebSocket) then disambiguate the paths on the wire.

## Transports — the binary/h2ts split

- **`proto` (binary) defaults to `{ unary: "h2ts", streaming: "h2ts" }`:** *real* gRPC over
  [h2ts](https://github.com/debdattabasu/h2ts) — real HTTP/2 tunneled over a WebSocket. The
  browser makes actual `application/grpc` calls and the server is **unmodified tonic** behind
  an h2ts gateway; there is no grpc-webnext translation on this path, and H2 supplies real
  framing, trailers, flow control, and many concurrent streams per connection. **This path
  is out of scope for this document** — see
  [`doc/H2TS_INTEGRATION.md`](../doc/H2TS_INTEGRATION.md) and the
  gRPC-over-HTTP/2 spec. Binary opts out per axis: `unary: "fetch"` uses the translated Fetch
  path, and `streaming: "ws"` uses the custom `Frame` protocol below.
- **`json` is locked to `{ unary: "fetch", streaming: "ws" }`:** always the custom protocol,
  never h2ts, so it stays plaintext and inspectable in browser devtools.

**The rest of this document specifies the custom `Frame` path** — the transport used by the
JSON codec (always) and by the binary codec only when the client selects `streaming: "ws"`
(unary likewise takes the Fetch path when `unary: "fetch"`). Two transports carry it: **Fetch**
for unary and a **single-stream WebSocket** `Frame` protocol for streaming, on the same port,
disambiguated by content-type / subprotocol.

## Content types

The **URL** picks the route — a `google.api.http` binding (`/v1/…`) is an **annotated
REST endpoint**, anything else is a **main gRPC path** (`/pkg.Service/Method`). The
content-type (Fetch) / subprotocol (WebSocket) then picks the codec, under **two
rules**:

1. **Plain HTTP** (`application/json` / *blank*) reaches annotated REST endpoints
   **always**; it reaches main paths **only with `ServerConfig::allow_implicit_codec`**.
2. **grpc-webnext** is the SDK: `+proto`/`+json` work on **all main paths**; `+json`
   **also** works on annotated endpoints (it's JSON). `+proto` doesn't fit the JSON
   REST surface.

| Content-type / WS subprotocol | Main path (`/pkg.Svc/Method`) | Annotated URL (`/v1/…`) |
|---|---|---|
| `application/grpc*` | passthrough (native gRPC) | — |
| `application/grpc-webnext+proto` | ✅ binary | ✗ 415 / close 4009 |
| `application/grpc-webnext+json` | ✅ JSON | ✅ JSON |
| `application/json` | flag off → **415** · on → ✅ | ✅ JSON |
| *(blank / no codec subprotocol)* | flag off → **415 / close 4012** · on → ✅ | ✅ JSON |

A WebSocket upgrade offering the **`h2ts`** subprotocol is the binary default — real gRPC
over an h2ts tunnel, out of scope here (see the split section above).

`allow_implicit_codec` is off by default; its whole job is rule 1's flag — *"may plain
HTTP reach the real gRPC method paths, or only the REST routes?"* Rejections are
**explicit**: Fetch → `415 Unsupported Media Type`; WebSocket → a close frame with a
private code `4000 + gRPC code` (`4012` UNIMPLEMENTED, `4009` FAILED_PRECONDITION). An
unknown content-type is `415`; a JSON call to a nonexistent method is `UNIMPLEMENTED`.

The codec is **native** on both transports: proto uses binary framing; JSON is
idiomatic JSON on the wire (never wrapped in the binary framing).

## Unary — Fetch

- **Request:** HTTP POST. Metadata → HTTP request headers; `grpc-timeout` carries the
  deadline. For **`+proto`** the body is the single message **length-prefixed** —
  `[ 4-byte big-endian length | message bytes ]`, mirroring the response's message block.
  The client already has the whole serialized message, so it prepends the length it
  knows; the server/proxy then turn it into a gRPC frame (prepend the `[1-byte flag]`)
  and **stream** it upstream without buffering to measure. For **`+json`** the body is
  the bare JSON text (buffered, since it's transcoded).
- **Response (`+proto`):** the browser cannot read HTTP trailers, so the server
  writes the body as two length-prefixed blocks:

  ```
  [ 4-byte big-endian length | message bytes ]
  [ 4-byte big-endian length | Trailer block ]
  ```

  The trailer block is an encoded `Trailer` (status + trailing metadata). The
  client buffers the whole body up to a **configurable size limit**. On the **server
  and the proxy** this response is **streamed, not buffered**: because the status rides
  in the trailer block *after* the message (not in a header), neither needs the whole
  message up front. The inner gRPC frame is already `[1-byte flag][4-byte length |
  message]`, so dropping the compression-flag byte yields our first block verbatim — the
  message is piped straight to the socket and the trailer block appended at the end. A
  large binary blob therefore isn't malloc'd. (The proxy does this opaquely — it never
  decodes the message — which is also why it does no retry: a wire proxy can't replay a
  streamed call, and retry belongs in the client anyway.)
- **Response (`+json`):** the body is the **bare JSON message**; gRPC status and
  metadata travel in HTTP response headers (`grpc-status`, `grpc-message`, plus
  metadata). No length-prefix, no trailer block — a plain JSON API you can `curl`.
  Unlike `+proto`, JSON **is** buffered on the server: it transcodes the whole protobuf
  message to JSON and the status goes in a header (which must precede the body), so the
  full message is needed before anything is written.
- Server-streaming does **not** use Fetch — it goes over WebSocket (Fetch would have
  to buffer the entire stream). Fetch is unary only. A genuinely *streamed* upload of
  unknown length also goes over WebSocket — the Fetch upload path assumes a known-length
  message (always true for protobuf), which is what lets the client supply the length
  prefix.

### REST transcoding (`google.api.http`)

Core gRPC is always `POST /pkg.Service/Method`. To get real HTTP verbs and REST
URLs, annotate methods with `google.api.http` (the grpc-gateway / Envoy standard):

```proto
rpc GetUser(GetUserReq) returns (User) {
  option (google.api.http) = {
    get: "/v1/users/{id}"
    additional_bindings { post: "/v1/users" body: "*" }
  };
}
```

The native server compiles these bindings from the descriptor set (the same
`Transcoder` used for `+json`) and, on the Fetch path, maps a matching
`(method, path)` onto the gRPC method — binding path segments, query params, and
the body into the request message, and returning the response as JSON. So
`GET /v1/users/123` and `POST /v1/users {…}` both reach `GetUser`. These annotated
endpoints are **JSON-only**: they accept plain HTTP (blank / `application/json`) *and*
`grpc-webnext+json` — all three transcode through the same path — but reject `+proto`
with **415** (`"REST-annotated endpoints are JSON-only"`), since binary framing doesn't
fit the REST surface. A plain request whose URL matches no binding is a direct
main-endpoint call, which requires `allow_implicit_codec` (else 415).

**Streaming methods** can be annotated too — the annotation URL is then a **WebSocket**
endpoint (`ws://host/v1/watch/123`, verb-agnostic since a WS upgrade is a GET). Such a
connection is **text-locked, single-stream JSON**, accepts a blank / `application/json`
/ `grpc-webnext+json` subprotocol (proto is rejected), and its gRPC method
+ path/query bindings come from the annotation. A
`body:"*"` route takes each frame's JSON as a request message; a body-less route (GET)
builds the single request entirely from the URL and streams the responses. See
"Streaming — WebSocket" below.

An annotation only **adds** the REST alias; it does not change the RPC's main path,
which stays reachable by its grpc-webnext content-types/subprotocols (the SDK contract)
and — when `allow_implicit_codec` is on — by plain HTTP like any other main path.

Supported subset: verbs `get/put/post/delete/patch` + `custom`; `additional_bindings`;
path templates with literal segments, `{field}`/`{field=*}` single-segment captures,
`{field=**}` rest-captures, and dotted field paths; `body: "*"` / `body: "<field>"` /
none; query-param binding to scalar/repeated fields. Not yet: `response_body`, regex
path patterns, non-scalar query binding (see `crates/grpc-webnext/src/httprule.rs`).

## Streaming — WebSocket

A WebSocket is either a **main-endpoint** connection (described here) or an **annotated
route** — if the upgrade URL matches a `google.api.http` binding, the connection is
text-locked, single-stream, JSON, accepts a blank / `application/json` /
`grpc-webnext+json` subprotocol (proto rejected), and its method +
path/query bindings come from the annotation (see the REST section). The rest of this
section describes the main-endpoint surface.

The connection's codec is chosen by the subprotocol; **every WebSocket carries exactly one
stream** (one stream per socket, never pooled):

| Subprotocol | Codec |
|---|---|
| `grpc-webnext+proto` | binary |
| `grpc-webnext+json` | JSON |

The client offers one of these alongside the base `grpc-webnext`; the server negotiates the
subprotocol back. A connection with **no** codec subprotocol (or a plain `application/json`
one) is rejected by default — closed with `UNIMPLEMENTED` (close code `4012`);
`ServerConfig::allow_implicit_codec` re-enables first-frame inference (blank ⇒ lock to first
frame's type; `application/json` ⇒ text). Either way the connection is single-codec — frames
of the other type are dropped.

### One WebSocket, one stream

The WS **URL is the route** (`ws://host/pkg.Svc/Method`), so the method is implied and
frames carry no `method`. The **first inbound frame opens** the stream (a `Subscribe`);
then `Message` / `HalfClose` / `Reset` flow on the same socket, and the server replies
`Header`, `Message`(s), `Trailer` / `Reset`. JSON is human-readable:

```jsonc
// client → server
{ "metadata": {…}, "timeoutMillis": 5000 } // open / Subscribe (optional; metadata/deadline)
{ "message": {…} }                         // data
{ "halfClose": true }                      // done sending (empty marker)
{ "status": { "code": 1, "message": "…" } }// client reset
// server → client
{ "metadata": {…} }                        // initial headers (Header)
{ "message": {…} }                         // data
{ "status": { "code": 0, "message": "" } } // terminal (trailer / reset)
```

Binary uses the same `Frame` envelope — a leading `Subscribe` (its method taken from the
URL, not read off the frame), then the same frame kinds encoded as protobuf. See
`crates/grpc-webnext/src/json_frame.rs`.

**One message per frame, no fragmentation** (both codecs).

**Keepalive** uses native **WebSocket ping/pong control frames** (RFC 6455 §5.5.2),
not application frames — HTTP/2 PING isn't reachable from browser JS, and a browser
can't send a WS ping from JS either, but it *does* auto-answer a server ping with a
pong. So the **server drives keepalive** (mirroring gRPC's `keepalive_time` /
`keepalive_timeout`):

- With `ServerConfig::ws_keepalive` (or `ProxyConfig::ws_keepalive`) set to an
  interval, an open streaming connection emits a ping each period. The peer's
  automatic pong is the return traffic that stops an idle-timeout proxy/LB from
  dropping a quiet stream.
- `ws_keepalive_timeout` (default 20s, gRPC's default) bounds the wait for a
  response. Any inbound frame — the pong, or ordinary stream data — proves liveness;
  if **nothing** arrives for `ws_keepalive + ws_keepalive_timeout`, the peer is
  presumed dead and the connection is **dropped** (the stream then surfaces
  `UNAVAILABLE`). This detects half-open connections in seconds instead of waiting
  out the OS TCP timeout.

Both are off by default (`ws_keepalive: None`). There is no application-level
ping/pong frame (the `Frame` oneof reserves the old field numbers 6/7).

### Auth

Auth is **per stream** (like gRPC call credentials / grpc-web — the browser has no
connection-level credential it can drive). `ServerConfig::stream_auth` is the
authoritative check, run on **every grpc-webnext stream on both transports** — each
WebSocket `Subscribe` and each unary Fetch call (a unary RPC is a one-shot stream). It
receives the method and the request metadata (`authorization` rides in the `Subscribe`
frame on WebSocket, or the HTTP request headers on Fetch) and returns a `Status`. That
status is not hardcoded to `UNAUTHENTICATED`: the hook may return any code (e.g.
`PERMISSION_DENIED` for a valid-but-unauthorized token). On WebSocket a failure becomes
a `Reset` carrying that status; on Fetch it becomes the response's `grpc-status` (so a
denied `+proto` call still returns HTTP 200 with the status in the trailer block, and a
`+json` call carries it in the `grpc-status` header). Native `application/grpc`
passthrough is **exempt** — that's the raw gRPC surface, guarded by the router's own
interceptors, not a grpc-webnext-translated stream.

On WebSocket there's an **optional handshake gate** so a bad credential can be rejected
*before any frame is read*. A browser can set only one handshake header —
`Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` — so the client auto-derives a `bearer.<token>` subprotocol from
the call's `authorization` metadata (stripping a `Bearer ` scheme; non-token-safe
credentials are skipped and just flow in the frame). It fires **only when that credential
is present**; the method it scopes to is **the URL path** — unambiguous, since the socket
*is* the stream. With **no credential** the connection just opens and the stream
self-authenticates from its `Subscribe` frame (per-stream `stream_auth`).

`ServerConfig::connect_auth(method, headers)` runs the gate (read the token with the
`ws_bearer_token` helper). On `Err(status)` the server **accepts the upgrade then
immediately closes** with a private code **`4000 + gRPC status`** (`4016` UNAUTHENTICATED),
message in the reason — JS reads `CloseEvent.code`/`.reason` and reconstructs a `Status`;
no stream is created. This is a WebSocket-specific early-reject optimization, not a
gRPC connection-auth layer (gRPC's connection auth is mTLS, which browser JS can't drive).

## Limits & error surfaces (wire-observable)

The happy paths above are the contract; these are the rejection and limit branches a
non-conforming or oversized client will actually hit. Where the native server and the
proxy differ, both are called out — those differences are wire-observable.

### Message size limits (`max_message_bytes`, default 4 MiB)

- **Fetch `+proto`** (server and proxy): only the 4-byte length prefix is read; if the
  *declared* length exceeds the limit → **HTTP 413** with a plain-text body
  `"request message exceeds size limit"`. Nothing is buffered to measure.
- **Fetch `+json`** (server and proxy): the oversized body is rejected with
  **`RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` in the `grpc-status` header** (HTTP 200) — *not* an HTTP 413. The
  JSON codec always carries status in the header, so both surfaces answer identically.
- **WebSocket** (server and proxy): an inbound message whose payload exceeds the limit
  (including a `Subscribe`'s inline `initial_payload`) terminates the stream with a
  `Reset{RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED, "request message exceeds size limit"}`. The transport's own
  frame limits (tungstenite's defaults) are a coarser backstop above that.

### Stream-level errors — in-band frames (WebSocket)

These arrive as ordinary frames on an already-open connection (not close codes):

- **`+json` with no transcoder/schema** → `Reset{UNIMPLEMENTED}` (server and proxy) — a
  pre-RPC capability rejection, so a `Reset`, not a terminal `Trailer`. (The message
  differs: the server says `"+json needs a transcoder"`, the proxy explains it's
  binary-only.)

The split between the two frame kinds is a **convention** worth stating: a `Reset` carries
a status for a stream rejected *before or outside* the RPC lifecycle (bad/oversized frame,
missing capability, auth failure, client cancel); a `Trailer` carries the
*terminal gRPC status of an RPC that reached the router/upstream* (normal completion or an
error status it returned). Both render to the same `{status}` JSON frame, so on a JSON
connection the distinction is invisible; it's observable only on a binary connection.

The `4000 + code` **close code** is used only for **connection-level** rejections at the
handshake (missing codec subprotocol → `4012`; auth-gate reject → `4016`), never for these
per-stream errors on an open connection.

### Fetch error surfaces (no transcoder)

- `+json`/JSON with **no** transcoder/schema configured → **`UNIMPLEMENTED` in the
  `grpc-status` header** (HTTP 200) on both the native server (no `ServerConfig::transcoder`)
  and the proxy (`SchemaSource::None`) — *not* an HTTP 501. With a transcoder present but the
  *method* unknown → likewise HTTP 200 + `grpc-status: 12`.
- Unknown content-type → **415**; `+proto` on a REST-annotated URL → **415**.

### JSON frame edge semantics (`json_frame_to_proto`)

The **first** inbound frame is the open: `json_open_to_subscribe` takes the method from the
WS URL and, if the frame carries a `message`, folds it into the `Subscribe`'s
`initial_payload` (open + first data together). **Every later** frame's kind is chosen by
which field is present, in priority order `status` → `halfClose` → `message` → *(none)*.
Consequences:

- A frame with **no recognized field** (`{}`, or a mistyped field name) decodes as a
  **half-close** — a typo silently ends the send side.
- Because `halfClose` outranks `message`, a frame carrying **both** ends the stream and
  drops the message.
- **Binary (`-bin`) metadata is dropped** crossing into the JSON codec — JSON frames carry
  ASCII metadata only.

### Encoding details

- **`grpc-message`** header values are **percent-encoded** — ASCII alphanumerics plus
  `` (space) `-` `_` `.` `/` `:` `` pass through, everything else becomes `%XX` — on the
  JSON Fetch path. The `+proto` paths carry status in a protobuf `Trailer`, so no header
  encoding applies there.
- **WebSocket close reasons** truncate to **123 bytes** on a UTF-8 char boundary
  (WebSocket caps the reason at 123 bytes). The `4000 + code` close is sent for any
  handshake-time rejection (missing codec subprotocol, or an in-process connect-auth failure).
- **`bearer.<token>` subprotocol**: "token-safe" means RFC 7230 token chars (`tchar`). The
  client strips a case-insensitive `Bearer ` scheme, then offers a **lowercase**
  `bearer.<token>` subprotocol only if the remaining token is token-safe (otherwise the
  credential just flows in the frame). The server matches the lowercase `bearer.` prefix
  **case-sensitively**.

### REST binding precedence

- **Path variables** always overlay the message (applied unconditionally).
- **Query parameters** bind only when `body` is **not** `"*"`. With `body: "*"` (the whole
  body *is* the message) query params are **ignored entirely**; path vars still overlay.
  For a non-wildcard body, a query param naming a field already set by a path var is
  skipped.

## In-process vs proxy: what needs schemas

grpc-webnext ships as **one crate** with two entry points over identical inbound handling:
`serve_in_process` wraps a local `tonic::service::Routes` (you own the service);
`serve_proxy` fronts a remote upstream over a `Channel`. Internally the only difference is
a `Backend` enum (`InProcess` / `Upstream`) — both are `Service::oneshot(request)` — so a
client can't tell a wrapped response from a proxied one. Either mode always parses the
WebSocket `Frame` envelope (headers, frame kind; the method comes from the WS URL) — that is
the protocol. Whether it must decode the **application payload** depends on the codec:

- `+proto` upstream `application/grpc` — payload forwarded **opaquely**, no schema. The
  proxy mode stays fully schema-agnostic here, fronting any gRPC server (Go, Java, …) with
  zero `.proto` knowledge.
- `+json` (and REST) — needs message descriptors to transcode JSON ↔ protobuf. Both modes
  **terminate** these: JSON request → binary protobuf, binary response → JSON back, via the
  same `Transcoder`, so the two modes are byte-identical.

The in-process mode gets its transcoder directly (`ServerConfig::transcoder`); the proxy
mode gets it from a configurable **schema source** (`ProxyConfig::schema`):

| `SchemaSource` | Descriptors from |
|---|---|
| `None` (default) | — `+json`/REST answer `UNIMPLEMENTED` |
| `Reflection` | upstream gRPC server reflection (v1, `v1alpha` fallback) |
| `Bundled(fds)` | a bundled `FileDescriptorSet` |
| `ReflectionOrBundled(fds)` | reflection, with the bundle as an immediate fallback |

Reflection is loaded **eagerly and whole** at startup — `list_services` plus each
service's transitive file closure, assembled into one snapshot — and refreshed on a TTL
(`reflection_ttl`, default 4h); an optional `admin_reload_path` (`POST`) forces an
immediate reload. Requests block (bounded) only for the very first load. The proxy frames
the **raw** descriptor bytes verbatim so custom options (e.g. `google.api.http`) survive —
but the upstream's reflection must itself preserve them; tonic-reflection currently strips
custom options ([grpc/grpc-rust#2719](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-rust/issues/2719), see
`doc/BACKLOG.md`), so REST-over-reflection against a tonic upstream needs a bundled set.
With `None` (or, in-process, no `transcoder`), `+json`/REST return `UNIMPLEMENTED` as a
proper status-in-header (Fetch) / `Reset` frame (WS) — never an HTTP 501, on either mode
(see "Limits & error surfaces").

## Reserved for later (not in v1)

Fragmentation of a single message across frames (for very large messages) is intentionally
out of scope. It would be added as a new `Frame` kind (e.g. `fragment`) so existing frames
are unaffected. Not built until there's demand.
